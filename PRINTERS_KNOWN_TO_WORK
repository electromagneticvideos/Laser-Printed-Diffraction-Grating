"Known to work" means both the with the sopftware in this project and also
with laser printer compatible transparency paper needed to make a
diffraction grating. 

HP LaserJet 4250dtn  Note: Any of the 42xx series should work. 
                     The 4250dtn is the printer I created the 
                     software for.
