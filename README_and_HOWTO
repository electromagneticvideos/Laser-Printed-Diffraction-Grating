DESCRIPTION
===========

This project is to allow you to create diffraction gratings on most (all?) HP PCL
compatible NETWORK CONNECTED laser printers.

To see what these grating can do, watch 
"Let's Measure the Wavelength of Light - with NO lab equipment!"

This means the printer must support the HP PCL page description language 
(most laser printers do) and support the raw printer access on network 
port 9100. This also known as  JetDirect, AppSocket, or Windows TCPmon.

You need to know your printer's IP number. 

This will not work with USB or otherwise connected printers. The application
uses the direct network connection to the printer in order to bypass the
operating systems printer drivers. This provides access to low level
hardware pixel drawing on the printer. 

I have included both source files (so you can modify if needed) and and compiled files
so you can "just run it". You will need java installed on your computer. 


TO MODIFY THE SOURCE
====================

The source is (surprizingly enough) in the directory called Source. There are two java
files, each a complete self contained command line application.

Generate_Diffraction_Grating.java will create a diffraction grating pattern and either 
save it to a file or send it to the printer without saving. At around line 200 you can specifiy 
the dpi the grting will be printed at and also the bit/pixel pattern to use. See the video
referenced above for details on different patterns. 

Network_Print.java will take a previopusly saved file and send it to the printer.

I used eclipse to create runnable jar files from these source files. The source 
file should worth with whatever your favorite java compiler and sdevelopment 
environment is. 


I JUST WANT TO RUN IT
=====================

The executables are in the Runnables directory.

Generate_Diffraction_Grating.jar will create a diffraction grating pattern and either 
save it to a file or send it to the printer without saving.  

Network_Print.java will take a previopusly saved file and send it to the printer.

You need to run these appliations on the command line in a terminal window. Run "cmd" 
on a windows machine and cd to the directory where you dumped these files. 

To create and send a 600 dpi grating directly to your printer, do
					 
			   java -jar Generate_Diffraction_Grating.jar -print printers_IP_number 

example: 

        java -jar Generate_Diffraction_Grating.jar -print 192.168.1.245 

Note: you have to replace 192.168.1.245 with the IP number of your printer. 


To send a previously generated grating directly to your printer, do

        java -jar Network_Print.jar filename printers_IP_number 

example: 
     
        java -jar Network_Print.jar diffraction_grating.prn 192.168.1.245 
			
Note: you have to replace 192.168.1.245 with the IP number of your printer. 

I have provided the following diffraction grating pattern files in the package
that you can use in place of diffraction_grating.prn above:

diffraction_grating_300dpi_1010101.prn

Prints at 300 dpi a pattern of alternating black and white stripes like this 
(white to white line/slit distance is 169 micro meters):

0101010101010 ...
0101010101010 ...
0101010101010 ...



diffraction_grating_600dpi_1001001.prn

Prints at 600 dpi a pattern of alternating black stipes followed by two white stripes 
like this (white to white line/slit distance is 127 micro meters):

1001001001001 ...
1001001001001 ...
1001001001001 ...

The double size white stripes make up for the black pixels bleeding into the white areas. 


WINDOWS USERS
=============

For windows users, I have incuded som batch files that should do the above for you just 
by clicking on them assuming they are in the same direcotry as the .jar and .prn files.


generate_and_print_600dpi_1001001.bat makes the 600dpi_1001001 grating described above 
and sends it directory to the printer without saving it to a file. You need to edit .bat 
the file with Notepad or similar to change the ip number in the batch file to your 
printers ip number before running this batch file. 

print_file_300dpi_1010101.bat reads the file diffraction_grating_300dpi_1010101.prn and 
and sends it directory to the printer without saving it to a file. You need to edit .bat 
the file with Notepad or similar to change the ip number in the batch file to your 
printers ip number before running this batch file. 

print_file_600dpi_1001001.bat reads the file diffraction_grating_600dpi_1001001.prn and 
and sends it directory to the printer without saving it to a file. You need to edit .bat 
the file with Notepad or similar to change the ip number in the batch file to your 
printers ip number before running this batch file.
